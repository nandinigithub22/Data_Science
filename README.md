INTRODUCTION

* Data
   A world-changing gamer is a key component for all companies and organizations.
Data is a crucial and most effective part of any business. Dealing with the raw data
which has no longer been accessible and cannot be utilized should be processed to use
efficiently. Then here comes data-wrangling which helps to turn non-resourceful (raw)
data into valuable data which in turn returns valuable information. Each step in the
process of wrangling the data is to the best possible analysis. The outcome is expected
to generate a robust and reliable analysis of the data.

* WHAT IS DATA WRANGLING?
Data Munging, commonly referred to as Data Wrangling, is the cleaning and
transforming of one type of data to another type to make it more appropriate into a
processed format. Data wrangling involves processing the data in various formats and
analyses and get them to be used with another set of data and bringing them together
into valuable insights. It further includes data aggregation, data visualization, and
training statistical models for prediction. Data wrangling is one of the most important
steps of the data science process. The quality of data analysis is only as good as the
quality of data itself, so it is very important to maintain data quality. Wrangling isn’t
just about wrangling, but it’s as important as the actual analysis process is done in the
process of analyzing your data, it’s a key part of your analysis.

Data science plays a crucial role in many industries and has a significant impact on various aspects of our lives. Here are some key reasons why data science is important:

 !  Informed Decision Making: Data science enables organizations to make better decisions by providing insights derived from data. This leads to more accurate forecasting, improved strategy, and enhanced business performance.

 !  Personalization: It allows for personalized experiences in sectors such as marketing, healthcare, and retail. By analyzing customer data, businesses can tailor their products, services, and communication to individual preferences and behaviors.

 !  Efficiency and Automation: Data science helps automate repetitive tasks and optimize processes. For example, predictive maintenance in manufacturing can reduce downtime and costs by predicting when equipment will fail.

 !  Competitive Advantage: Companies that effectively utilize data science gain a competitive edge by understanding market trends, consumer behavior, and operational efficiencies better than their competitors.

 !  Risk Management: Data science is essential in identifying and mitigating risks. In finance, it helps in detecting fraudulent transactions, assessing credit risks, and managing investment portfolios.

 !  Innovation: By uncovering patterns and trends in data, data science drives innovation. It leads to the development of new products, services, and solutions that address unmet needs or improve existing offerings.

 !  Healthcare Advancements: In healthcare, data science contributes to better diagnosis, treatment plans, and patient outcomes. It helps in analyzing medical records, predicting disease outbreaks, and personalizing patient care.

 !  Scientific Research: Data science accelerates scientific research by enabling the analysis of large datasets, which can lead to new discoveries and advancements in various fields, from genetics to climate science.

 !  Public Policy and Governance: Governments use data science to make informed policy decisions, improve public services, and address social issues. For instance, data analysis can help in urban planning, crime prevention, and disaster response.

 !  Enhanced Customer Insights: Businesses gain deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing them to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention.

Overall, data science is a powerful tool that transforms data into actionable insights, driving growth, efficiency, and innovation across multiple domains.
