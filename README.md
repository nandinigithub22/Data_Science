INTRODUCTION
Data- a world-changing gamer is a key component for all companies and organizations.
Data is a crucial and most effective part of any business. Dealing with the raw data
which has no longer been accessible and cannot be utilized should be processed to use
efficiently. Then here comes data-wrangling which helps to turn non-resourceful (raw)
data into valuable data which in turn returns valuable information. Each step in the
process of wrangling the data is to the best possible analysis. The outcome is expected
to generate a robust and reliable analysis of the data.
WHAT IS DATA WRANGLING?
Data Munging, commonly referred to as Data Wrangling, is the cleaning and
transforming of one type of data to another type to make it more appropriate into a
processed format. Data wrangling involves processing the data in various formats and
analyses and get them to be used with another set of data and bringing them together
into valuable insights. It further includes data aggregation, data visualization, and
training statistical models for prediction. Data wrangling is one of the most important
steps of the data science process. The quality of data analysis is only as good as the
quality of data itself, so it is very important to maintain data quality. Wrangling isn’t
just about wrangling, but it’s as important as the actual analysis process is done in the
process of analyzing your data, it’s a key part of your analysis.
NEED FOR WRANGLING :
Wrangling the data is crucial, yet it is considered as a backbone to the entire analysis
part. The main purpose of data wrangling is to make raw data usable. In other words,
getting data into a shape. On average, data scientists spend 75% of their time wrangling
the data, which is not a surprise at all. The important needs of data wrangling include,
 The quality of the data is ensured.
 Supports timely decision-making and fastens data insights.
 Noisy, flawed, and missing data are cleaned.
 It makes sense to the resultant dataset, as it gathers data that acts as a preparation
stage for the data mining process.
 Helps to make concrete and take a decision by cleaning and structuring raw data
into the required format.
 Raw data are pieced together to the required format.
 To create a transparent and efficient system for data management, the best
solution is to have all data in a centralized location so it can be used in improving
compliance.
 Wrangling the data helps make decisions promptly and helps the wrangler clean,
enrich, and transform the data into a perfect picture.
